# AutoDisconnect - 1.19 - Fabric

A simple Minecraft mod that automatically disconnects players when they are in low health.

Inspired by personal experiences and the fact that no similar mod can be found since it is... obviously a hack.

If you want to keep the spirit of the game, it is better not to use this mod (especially when playing with your friends).
